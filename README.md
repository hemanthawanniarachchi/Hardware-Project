# Automated Wire Cutting and Stripping Machine

**Introduction**<br>
There are so many fundamental problems that we have identified in underdeveloped small-scale
industries. So nowadays lack of labor is a major problem and it is hard to find trained workers. Our
focus was on the wire cutting industry. Hardware shops and electronic labs can be taken as
examples in our research area. So, we have identified different difficulties when cutting and
stripping different sizes of wires.
• Labors may face injuries when using sharp cutters for these processes.
• Efficiency of work would be low when considering the labor
• Accuracy of the outcome would be low on sometimes
We can overcome these difficulties with help of system automation.
The automation system solves labor problems which save cost, increases accuracy, and decrease
human errors. After surveying various electrical and electronics industries we conclude that
nowadays the industries have introduced automation in their systems to some extent, but they use
human resources for some basic processes which are time-consuming like wire cutting, winding,
etc. If we introduce automation to these basic processes, then it will be fruitful regarding the
company’s development and profit gain as it improves the system in many ways. Not only at the
industrial level even in university labs students face some difficulties when cutting wires.
One such industry found out in which they need a solution that is very efficient, fast, and
economical for cutting various lengths of wires which are required for producing requirements.
So, we try to make a cost-effective Automatic Wire Cutting and Stripping Machine. This machine
mainly helpful for electronic labs and hardware shops.
